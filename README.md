<h1>Purpouse of implementing a ticket system</h1>

1. Review the current state of the ticket system and verify which tasks are toils and which are not.

2. Adress the toil to the correct personnel by categorizing them according to technical skills.

3. Use a commercial incident management tool like PagerDuty or free tools like prometheus or alermanager in order to monitor with customizable alerts.

4. Do as much as possible to eliminate toil by using automation, such as scripting or self-service methods.
